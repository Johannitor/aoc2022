# Advent of Code 2020

Repository to store all my generated code while solving the [Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

I'm going to use Typescript with ts-node.

## Structure

Every day of the challenge will get a separate directory in the `days`-directory with an index.ts inside.
Additional files required/generated for a day will also be placed in the same folder.

Every day will also get a separate npm script command for easy execution (`npm run day-[number]`);

Project will also contain an `utils`-directory for shared code.
